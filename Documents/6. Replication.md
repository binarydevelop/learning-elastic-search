Replication
An index in one Elasticsearch cluster can be configured to replicate changes from an index in another Elasticsearch cluster. The index that is replicating changes is termed a follower index and the index being replicated from is termed the leader index.

Replication is enabled by default in elasticsearch.
How does replication work in elasticsearch?

Replpication is configured at the index level. It works by creating copies of shards.

When creating an index, we can choose how many replicas of each shard that we want, with one being the default value.

We have physical copies of each of our shards, but how does that help if the entire disk stops working, and we lose all of its data? To prevent this from happening, replica shards are never stored on the same node as their primary shard.

Elasticsearch supports snapshot, so we can either snapshot a single index or an entire cluster.
