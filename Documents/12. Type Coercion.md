### Introduction
- Elasticsearch checks the data types for each field value when we index adocument.
A part of this process is to validate the data types and reject field values that are
obviously invalid.
An example of that would be trying to index an object for a text field.

- Type coercion comes into play when we try to index another data type instead of one provided in the mapping. Elastic search then converts it into suitable data type accordingly if convertible and indexes it.
Example
```
PUT /products/_doc
{
    "price":35
}
//At this step dynamic mappinng happens and price is assigned integer type.
PUT /products/_doc
{
    "price":"35"
}
// Indexing a string where integer is required coercion takes effect.
PUT /products/_doc
{
    "price":"35MK"
}
//will Fail because 35mk is not convertible to number. 
```

Though the price gets stored as numeric value in 2nd case when we fetch it in the ```_source ``` it would be a string. As it reflects the original value but internally it has a numeric value.
