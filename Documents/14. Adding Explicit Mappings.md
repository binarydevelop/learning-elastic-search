### Explicit Mappings
 - We can add field mappings both when creating an index and afterwards.
 - We do that by defining the mappings within a “mappings” key when we add a new index.  
All field mappings should be defined within a “properties” key. That’s the case for fields at every level of the hierarchy, including nested objects. 
```JSON
PUT /reviews
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "author": {
        "properties": {
          "firstname":{"type": "text"},
          "lastname":{"type": "text"},
          "email":{"type": "keyword"}
        }
      },
      "rating": {"type": "float"},
      "content": {"type": "text"},
      "product_id": {"type":"integer"}
    }
  }
}
```
Let's create a document within this index

```
PUT /reviews
{
    "author": {
        "firstname": "Tushar",
        "lastname": "Roy",
        "email": "binarydevelop@gmail.com"
    },
    "rating": 5.0,
    "content": "This is a test for mapping"
    "product_id": 2
}
```

### Retrieving Mappings

To retrieve the mapping for an index, we can send a GET request to the Mapping API as follows. 

```
GET /reviews/_mapping
```
- In addition to retrieving mappings for the entire index, it is also possible to retrieve
the mapping for a specific field.
To do that, we simply use the “field” command, followed by the name of the field.
```
GET /reviews/_mapping/field/content
```

For Objects
```
GET /reviews/_mapping/field/author.email
```
- We can also use dot notation to define our mappings like
```JSON
PUT /reviews
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "author.firstname": {"type": "text"},
      "author.lastname": {"type": "text"},
      "author.email": {"type": "keyword"},
      "rating": {"type": "float"},
      "content": {"type": "text"},
      "product_id": {"type":"integer"}
    }
  }
}
```

### Adding Mappings to existing indices
- We will still use the PUT HTTP verb, but this time we will invoke the Mapping API.
Since we are using the Mapping API, we should not specify the “mappings” key as we did
when creating the index.
Instead, we specify the “properties” key at the top level of the request body.
The rest of the syntax is the same.

```JSON
PUT /reviews/_mapping
{
  "properties":{
    "created_at":{"type":"date"}
  }
}
```
