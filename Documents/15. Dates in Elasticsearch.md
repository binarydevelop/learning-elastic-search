### Introduction

- Dates may be specified in one of three ways; specially formatted strings, a long number
representing the number of milliseconds since the epoch, or an integer representing the
number of seconds since the epoch.  
Epoch refers to the 1st of January 1970. 
The default behaviour of elastic search with date is it expects one of three formats; a date without time, a date with time, or a long representing the number of milliseconds since the epoch.  

- In the case of string timestamps, these are assumed to be in the UTC timezone if none is specified.
If you supply a string value, the date needs to be in the ISO 8601 format. This is the most standard date format and what is generally used besides numeric timestamps.

\- Dates are stored as a long number representing the number of milliseconds since the epoch.
Even if we supply a string date, Elasticsearch will parse it and convert it to a long number for storage.
