### Handling Misssing Fields

- This means that all fields are actually optional and you are free to leave them out completely when indexing documents.That’s different from relational databases where you need to explicitly allow NULL values.  

- Elasticsearch will validate field values against any mapping that might exist, but it won’t reject documents that leave fields out.
To be clear, you can leave out fields even if a mapping exists for it, so adding a field
mapping does not make the field required.
