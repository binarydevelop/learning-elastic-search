# Sharding

- We know that a cluster can have multiple nodes, that is one of the ways in which elasticsearch scales up both in terms of disk space and data storage.

- Suppose if we want to store 1 terabyte of data and we only have a single node with 500 gigabytes
of space, that's obviously not going to work.
However, if we add an additional node with sufficient capacity, Elasticsearch can then
store data on both nodes, meaning that the cluster now has enough storage capacity.</br>
<span style="color:yellow;"> But how does that actually work? </span> </br>
Elasticsearch does this by using something called sharding.

<span style="color:red;"> Sharding </span> is a way to divide an index into separate pieces, where each piece is called
a shard.

- Each piece is referred to as shard. 
- Sharding is always done at the index level.
- A shard may be placed on any node, so if an index has five shards, for instance, we don't need to spread these out on five different nodes.
- Each shard is independent, and you can think of a shard as being a fully functional index on its own.
- Before elasticsearch 7.0 the default value for number of shards was 5 which could led to over-sharding if we had small indices.</br>
So the deafult value after this version is 1 and if we need to increase or decrease the number of shards we can do so through split and shrink api's.
