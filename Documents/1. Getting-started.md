## Introduction 

- **Elastic search** is a distributed, open source RESTful search and analytics engine and analytics engine built on Apache Lucene for all types of data including textual, numerical, geoSpatial, structured and unstructured.

- Elasticsearch is a document oriented database, where data is stored in form of JSON documents.

- Elasticsearch is the central component of Elastic Stack, which is a set of tools for data ingestion, enrichment, storage, analysis and visualization. 

<span style="color:red;font-size: 13px">Data Ingestion</span>
 <span style = "font-size: 14px"> is the transportation of data from assorted sources to a storage medium where it can be accessed, used, and analyzed by an organization. </span>

## ELK stack
ELK stack includes: 
1. Elastic search
2. Logstash (Data processing pipeline)
3. Kibana (Used mainly for visualization)
4. Beats

<span style="color: yellow; font-size: 18px"> Why is Elastic search even needed?</br></span>
Products that involve e-commerce and search engines with huge databases face issues including product information retrieval taking too long. This leads to poor user experience. 
Also we have lag in search as the data is spread across different numbers of tables and meaningful data retrieval means fetching data from all these tables.

It’s able to achieve fast search responses because instead of searching the text directly, it searches an index. It uses a structure based on documents instead of tables and schemas and comes with extensive REST APIs for storing and searching the data.

<span style= "color: Orange">Logical Concepts </span>
</br> <span style= "color:grey">1. Documents </br> </span>
- Documents are the basic unit of information that can be indexed in Elasticsearch. Document is like a row in a relational Database representing a given entity. 
Example:

```JSON
//A document is basically a json object with key-value pairs
{
"firstName": "John",
"lastName": "Doe",
}
```

 </br>  <span style= "color:grey">2. Indices </br> </span>
- An index is a collection of documents that have similar characteristics. 
- An index is the highest level entity that we can query against in Elasticsearch.
We can think of index as a table where several documents or rows can be stored. In the context of an e-commerce website, for example, we can have an index for Customers, one for Products, one for Orders, and so on.
- An index is identified by a name that is used to refer to the index while performing indexing, search, update, and delete operations against the documents in it.

</br> <span style= "color:grey">3. Inverted Index </br> </span>
- Elastic search uses a data structure called Inverted Index by which most of the search engines work. 


- It is a data structure that stores a mapping from content, such as words or numbers, to its locations in a document or a set of documents. Basically, it is a hashmap-like data structure that directs from a word to a document.


- An inverted index doesn’t store strings directly and instead splits each document up to individual search terms (i.e. each word) then maps each search term to the documents those search terms occur within.

<span style= "color:grey">1.Cluster </br> </span>
An Elasticsearch cluster is a group of one or more node instances that are connected together. The power of an Elasticsearch cluster lies in the distribution of tasks, searching, and indexing, across all the nodes in the cluster.

</br> <span style= "color:grey">2.Node </br> </span>
- A node is a single server that is a part of a cluster. A node stores data and participates in the cluster’s indexing and search capabilities.

- An Elasticsearch node can be configured in different ways:
1. Master Node — Controls the Elasticsearch cluster and is responsible for all cluster-wide operations like creating/deleting an index and adding/removing nodes.

2. Data Node — Stores data and executes data-related operations such as search and aggregation.

3. Client Node — Forwards cluster requests to the master node and data-related requests to data nodes.

<span style= "color:grey">3. Shards </br> </span>
- Elasticsearch provides the ability to subdivide the index into multiple pieces called shards. Each shard is in itself a fully-functional and independent “index” that can be hosted on any node within a cluster. 
-  It is basically a subset of documents of an index.
- By distributing the documents in an index across multiple shards, and distributing those shards across multiple nodes, Elasticsearch can ensure redundancy, which both protects against hardware failures and increases query capacity as nodes are added to a cluster. 

<span style= "color:grey">4. Replicas </br> </span>
- Elasticsearch allows us to make one or more copies of your index’s shards which are called replica shards. Basically, a replica shard is a copy of a primary shard. Each document in an index belongs to one primary shard.

- Replicas provide redundant copies of your data to protect against hardware failure and increase capacity to serve read requests like searching or retrieving a document.
